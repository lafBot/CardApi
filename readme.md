# Card Generator from API  

The purpose of this project was to play around with a card API and create functions that will draw info from http://deckofcardsapi.com/.  

My HTML site will allow you to draw random cards from the same deck until all 52 cards of the deck have been chosen.

## Future Possibilties:
Possibilities for the future include creating card games as well as uses for machine learning for predicting future cards for a game of blackjack.

## Before you start:
Notice that there are two .js files.  async_app.js will include asynchronous functions for calling to the api, while the other will not.  You must uncomment the script src in the index.html file to see the alternate method.
